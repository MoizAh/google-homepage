I have completed the Google Homepage project from The Odin Project. I have a little bit of experience with HTML and CSS but I quickly moved onto libraries such as Bootstrap 4 which was interesting because I was always unsure of my abilities to make something from scratch. This project gave me a better understanding of my abilities and a glimpse how much time and dedication it really takes to create something from the ground-up.

NOTES: this draft is desktop-only. As I continue with The Odin Project, I will continue to work on the mobile responsiveness of the website and refine it.
